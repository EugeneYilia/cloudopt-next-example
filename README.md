# cloudopt-next-example

Cloudopt Next is a very lightweight micro-service framework based on kotlin and vertx for the Next generation. You can handle url parsing, data encapsulation, and Json output. Radically reduce development time and improve development experience. Cloudopt Next absorbed the ideas of [Spring Boot](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot)，[JFinal](https://github.com/jfinal/jfinal)，[Resty](https://github.com/Dreampie/Resty)，[Vertx](https://github.com/vert-x3/vertx-web) and other excellent projects, and not only had a very good development experience, but also had a very low learning curve.
